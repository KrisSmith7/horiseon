# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor
For this week's challenge, my goal was to refactor an existing webpage to make it accessible and to improve SEO.

I attempted this by:
    - updating title of web page "website" to "Horiseon"
    - directing the "Search Engine Optimization" link to the appropriate section of the page
    - adding alts to banner imgs, made empty alts on icons

I also attempted to follow the scout role by:
    - adding semantic HTML <section>, <header>, <footer>, <nav>
    - removing </img> in cost management - this is a self closing tag
    - adding comments in HTML and CSS code
    - consolidating CSS selectors and properties when appropriate



To impress the imaginary client for this Challenge, you should go the extra mile and improve their codebase for long-term sustainability. Ensure that all links are functioning correctly and clean up the CSS to make it more efficient, such as by consolidating CSS selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and including comments before each element or section of the page.

## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage that meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN I find that they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```
